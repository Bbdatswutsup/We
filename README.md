<p>This timeline is designed to be as complete as possible. This means that not only am I drawing events from the show, but also from <strong>all</strong> officially licensed material, including the main comic series. People generally don't consider it canon due to the lack of subtlety in its plot and the fact that it is often incompatible with the show. The "official" stance on the canonicity of the comics is blurred. Ryan North, the original writer of the main comic series, has <a href="http://ryannorth.tumblr.com/post/23729809967/something-that-comes-up-pretty-often-is-this">claimed that they are pretty much canon</a>, but Adam Muto, executive producer of the show, <a href="https://ask.fm/MrMuto/answers/134245195208">has suggested otherwise</a>. I'm going to treat the comics like an alternate timeline, which leaves me free to selectively choose which elements I include in the main timeline. I will leave out anything that contradicts the show's continuity, but if an element fits then I see no reason to omit it. At the end of the main timeline I will show some "alternate timelines" such as Farmworld and the various timelines caused by time travel in the comics.</p>
<p>Other sources which have been used include video games and books. Whenever I make a statement or pull a quote from somewhere, I will show the source in square brackets [like this]. That way, you can make up your own mind whether or not you choose to believe a certain element is canon.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Adventure_Time_episodes#Episodes">official season arrangement</a> for labelling episodes, which is the arrangement composed of ten seasons used by Cartoon Network and Wikipedia but not the one used by the fan wiki and the Adventure Time crew. For example, <em>Elemental</em> is S08E08 rather than S07E34. This doesn't affect the order of individual episodes in any way, so it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>For labelling things with a real-life date, I have assumed that <strong>0 AMB = 2010 CE</strong>.</p>
<p>The Mushroom Bomb and the Blue Catalyst Comet hit at approximately the same time. Uniting these two pivotal events makes it much easier to put a date to things, so I have assumed that they both take place in 0 AMB.</p>
